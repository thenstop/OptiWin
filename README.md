# OptiWin
I'm not letting a scummy company win. Shame on you Hone.gg.

## My changes and attributions - for copyright and legal reasons

- License was kept under a GPL-based or copyleft license which complies completely with the source license and its ruling.

- I made many changes myself, including changing and removing tweaks, fixing tweaks, adding tweaks of my own, and overall cleaning up the project.

- It is not just a reupload of the same project like many inactive forks on GitHub that never recieve a commit.

- I used my own resources, such as the power plan, and also used a customized version of the NVIDIA control panel settings.
  - Hone does not own the legal right to the base profile that NVIDIA applies after driver installation.
  - It easily could have been copied from somewhere else in the first place
 
- I removed and replaced all potential copyright assets.

## What I will do going forward

- Attempt to get the commit history in order to further prove my case.

- Not fork tweaking projects because there are some weird people in this community.
